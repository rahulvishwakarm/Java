1. Stack is the linear data structures which follows particular Order to perform operations
2. Order may be LIFO(Last in first out) or FILO(First In first out)
ex: Plate stacked over another in canteen, the plates are added to the top of stack, first plate put in the stack is the last plate to be used.
3. Stack is the ordered list in which insertion and the deletion are done from same end is called as "top" end.
4. Last element to be inserted is the first element to be first element to be removed.
5. When the element is inserted in the stack , the operation is called as push operation.
6. When the element is removed from the stck , the operation is called as pop operation.
7. Trying to pop element from empty stack is called underflow.
8. Trying to push the element in the full stack is called as overflow.


Stack ADT:

Main Stack Operation:
Push(int data) : Insert data onto stack
int Pop() : Removes and return the last inserted element from the stack

Auxillary Stack Operation:
int Top() : Returns the last inserted element from the stack
int Size() : Returns the number of elements stored in stack
int IsEmptyStack() : Indicates whether any elements are stored in the stack or not
int IsFullStack() : Indicates whether stack is full or not

Operations:
a. Push - Add the item in the Stack
b. Pop - Remove the iten from stack
c. Peek or Top - Return the topmost item
d. isEmpty - Return True if stack is empty

Ways to implement Stack:
1. Using Array
2. Using Linked List
